Auto Test Cases:

All requests in one test are pipelined and feed into one routing daemon via the same TCP connection

How to run test
    Enter each sub folder of test_x, run the test.sh script, if you see the diff output like:
        Files tmp.res and res are identical
    This means the test had passed.

test_1:
    Topology:
        A--B--C
    Request:
        Ask A for files on A
        Ask A for files on B and C
        Ask A for files on C
    Expected Response:
        URL should be local, on B, on B
    Test Purpose:
        Basic routing function, basic shortest path

test_2:
    Topology:
        A B C connected to each other
    Request:
        Ask A for files on A and B
        Ask A for files on B and C
        Ask A for files only on C
    Expected Response:
        URL should be local, on B, on C
    Test Purpose:
        Shortest path on node_id

test_3:
    Topology:
        A--B--C
    Request:
        Ask A for files on C
        Ask A to add a file
        Ask A for the same file just added
    Expected Response:
        URL should be on B first and then local
    Test Purpose:
        Simulating cache behavior

test_4:
    Topology:
        A--B--C--D
         \      /
          \    /
           \  /
             E
    Request:
        Ask A for files on B
        Ask A for files on C
        Ask A for files on D
    Expected Responses:
        URL should be on B, B, E
    Test Purpose:
        Shortest path algorithm
